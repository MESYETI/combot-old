## Setup
Move main.py out of the combot folder and run setup.py<br>This will set up ComBot Economies, banned and admins and optionally adding your Discord account ID to admins.txt<br>
You should also replace the string in the bottom line of main.py to your bot's ID or it won't work.
## Running
Just run main.py and everything should work as long as you have the dependencies
